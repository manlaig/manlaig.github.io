In some games, like Starcraft, they have a grid that shows the collisions. This writing will go over on implementing a similar object placement."}}},{"node":{"id":"e67b340f-ee30-5929-9444-fe5423ce8f9e","frontmatter":{"title":"Implementing Image Convolutions in Python","date":"November 21, 2018","path":"/convolution","excerpt":"Ever wondered how blurs and edge detections work on images, it's much simple than you expect. In this writing, I will implement a convolution algorithm and use it to blur and edge detect on images."}}},{"node":{"id":"3b18792c-c35c-565a-a0de-f8e9eab410d6","frontmatter":{"title":"Binary Search Tree in C++","date":"November 19, 2018","path":"/bst","excerpt":"Binary Search Trees are very interesting data structures. It's a tree where each node of the tree has up to 2 nodes, left and right.
