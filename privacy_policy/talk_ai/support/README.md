## Talk AI App Support

Hello, thanks for stopping by. I know this is not much, but hopefully you can find anything you need here :)

That includes app feedbacks, account deletions, feature requests, etc.
I apologize for the simplicity of this page, I'm not a big fan of web development myself.

### Feedbacks, Feature Requests

If you want to give app feedbacks or feature requests, please submit [this](https://forms.gle/5dnL9EkvBgTbyf4c9) form.

The only people that do give me feedbacks are my family and friends, so it means a lot to hear from other users.
Even if it's negative, I appreciate that you tried my app :)

### Account Deletion

If you want your account deleted, you can totally do that too.
Our app requests basic Facebook permissions (name and public profile picture), so we don't have your email or friends in our database.

Furthermore, if you authenticate with Facebook and set a custom name, then only your public profile picture is left unchanged.
This allows us to reduce costs on our backend and also avoid storing sensitive user data.

If you want to get your account data wiped, please submit [this](https://forms.gle/y4B7R2nmDbFHyduv8) form.

With the information in the submitted form, I will make sure the user IDs match before deleting the account data and I'll send a confirmation once the data is deleted.
I always liked the idea of releasing an app and supporting it. I'm happy to help with any requests. Please let me know how I can help you!

Another method of contact can be through email (manlai@berkeley.edu).
