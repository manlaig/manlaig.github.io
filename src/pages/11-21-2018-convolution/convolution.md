title: "Implementing Image Convolutions in Python"
excerpt: "Ever wondered how blurs and edge detections work on images, it's much simple than you expect. In this writing, I will implement a convolution algorithm and use it to blur and edge detect on images."

In this writing, I will write a script in Python that does a convolution on an image and use it to do some cool image processing. 

You will need `PIL` for this, `PIL` is an image processing library.

## Definition

Convolution is a process of adding each pixel value of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel. Kernel is just a matrix that we'll use to change the pixel values.

Here's a good illustration from [Deep Learning:](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano_versions/dev/tutorial/conv_arithmetic.html)

You can see the kernel is going over the image and changing the pixel values according to its weights of [ [2,0,1], [1,0,0], [0,1,1] ].

Our script will work similar to this. Note that the illustration above has a **padding** of same, meaning that the kernel starts out of the image. By doing this, we can calculate pixel values for pixels at the edge.

Also, this illustration has a **stride** of 2, meaning that it jumps 2 pixels each time. Not having a stride of 1 will create an image different sized than the original.

Our script will have a padding of same, a stride of 1, and a kernel size of 3 by 3.

Here's another good illustration from [Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano_versions/dev/tutorial/conv_arithmetic.html) that shows exactly what out convolution function will do:

## Coding

First, we need to get the input image and open it with `PIL`.

```python
im = Image.open(sys.argv[1])
im_matrix = np.asarray(im)
```

`im_matrix` is a matrix that contains all the pixel values of the input image.

Next, we create an empty matrix, which will be the output image.

```python
output_im = np.empty(im_matrix.shape)
```

Now, we loop through the whole input image and calculate new pixel values for each pixel.

```python
kernel = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

for i in range(im_matrix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(im_matrix.shape[1]):
        for k in range(im_matrix.shape[2]):
            output_im[i][j] = getNewPixelValue(im_matrix, i, j, k, kernel)
```

`getBlurValue` function looks like this:
 
```python
def getNewPixelValue(im, pixel_y, pixel_x, channel, kernel):
    pixel_val = 0
    offset = int(kernel_size/2)

    for i in range(-offset, offset+1, 1):
        for j in range(-offset, offset+1, 1):
            if pixel_x + j < 0 or pixel_y + i < 0:
                continue
            if (pixel_x + j < im.shape[1] - 1
                and pixel_y + i < im.shape[0] - 1):
               pixel_val += im[pixel_y + i][pixel_x + j][channel] * kernel[i + offset][j + offset]
    return max(pixel_val, 0)
```

The full can be found in my GitHub [repo.](https://github.com/manlaig/image_convolutions)

Using the `getNewPixelValue` function, you can do convolutions on images with different filters, such as sharpening, embossing, and so on.

Here's an example of convolution done with this function.

## Blur

Using the Gaussian blur filter, we can blur images. The bigger the size of the kernel, the more blurred the image will be.

3x3 filter was not blurring well, so I used this 5x5 filter and got this result.

## Conclusion

There's so much to explore with convolutions, image processing and even convolutional neural networks use them. I found them to be very interesting and wanted to write my own and share it with others.
