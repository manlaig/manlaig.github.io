## Welcome

Hello, thanks for stopping by. I know this is not much, but hopefully you can find anything you need here :)

That includes app feedbacks, account deletions, feature requests, etc.
I apologize for the simplicity of this page, I'm not a big fan of web development myself.

If you want to give app feedbacks or feature requests, please visit [this](https://forms.gle/5dnL9EkvBgTbyf4c9) form.

If you want your account deleted, you can totally do that here too.
Our app requests basic Facebook permissions (name and public profile picture), so we don't have your email in our database.

Furthermore, if you authenticate with Facebook, then set a custom name. In that case, only your public profile picture is unchanged.
This allows us to reduce costs on our backend and also avoid storing sensitive user data.
If you want to get your account data wiped, please submit [this](https://forms.gle/t1dh81MDMFcsdasM7) form.
