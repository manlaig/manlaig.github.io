Also, training the network to take into account the ball's velocity. Later, I will train the network again, but with multiple subsequent frames, so that it can learn the velocity of the ball.</p>\n<p>In the future, I want to use Reinformencement Learning instead of Supervised Learning.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 11, 2018","path":"/ardraw","title":"Making a 3D drawing AR app in Unity"}}},"pageContext":{}}
